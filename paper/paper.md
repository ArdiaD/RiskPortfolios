# Summary

`RiskPortfolios` is an R package (@R) for constructing risk-based portfolios. It provides a set of
functionalities to build mean-variance, minimum variance, inverse-volatility weighted (@LeoteEtAl2012),
equal-risk-contribution (@MaillardEtAl2010), maximum diversification (@Choueifaty2008), and
risk-efficient (@AmencEtAl2011) portfolios. Optimization is achieved with the R packages `quadprog` (@quadprog) and `nloptr` (@nloptr).
Long or gross constraints can be added to the optimizer.
As risk-based portfolios are mainly based on covariances, the package also provides a large set of covariance matrix estimators. A simulation study relying on the package is described in @ArdiaEtAl2016. The latest version of the package is
available at 'https://github.com/ArdiaD/RiskPortfolios'.
